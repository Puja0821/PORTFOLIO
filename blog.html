        <h2>My Internship Experience at Criss Financial Ltd.</h2>
        <p> 
During my 6-month internship at Criss Financial Ltd., I gained invaluable hands-on experience working with a variety of modern web technologies including React, Node.js, and MySQL. This opportunity allowed me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects and develop practical skills in full-stack development.

Throughout my internship, I successfully completed two major projects that challenged me to think critically and work collaboratively. The first project was a Content Management System (CMS) designed to efficiently handle and manage website content. This system enabled users to easily create, update, and organize web pages, improving the overall user experience and site maintenance.

The second project was a Health Insurance Portal, which provides insurance coverage options for individuals and their families. This portal simplified the process of selecting and managing health insurance plans, making it more accessible and user-friendly for clients.

These experiences not only strengthened my technical expertise but also taught me the importance of communication, problem-solving, and adaptability in a professional environment. I am excited to carry these lessons forward as I continue to grow and contribute effectively in my future roles.
