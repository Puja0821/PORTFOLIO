        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h2>
        <p>
            I’m excited to share my journey, skills, and aspirations with you. As a passionate web developer, I’ve dedicated myself to mastering the art of building engaging, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. My foundation began with studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the building blocks of the web. From there, I expanded into frameworks and libraries like React and Bootstrap that allow me to craft dynamic and responsive interfaces. On the backend, Node.js and Express empower me to create robust server-side solutions that can handle complex functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Applications from Christ University, Delhi-NCR, which provided me with a thorough grounding in computer science and software development concepts. This educational background, coupled with my hands-on experience, gives me the confidence to tackle any coding challenge with a disciplined and enthusiastic approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technology is always evolving, and I embrace this by continuously learning new tools and techniques. Currently, I am focusing on mastering containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes, aiming to build scalable and maintainable applications that meet modern development standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond coding, I am passionate about collaboration and creative problem-solving. I believe that the best solutions arise when diverse ideas come together in a supportive environment. I’m eager to contribute to innovative projects and grow alongside other driven professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Feel free to explore my portfolio, and if my skills align with your needs, let’s connect and create something amazing together!
